## Real-Time-Sudoku-Solver
Python application to solve Sudoku puzzle and overlays solution on to real image in real-time. 

This project is solely inspired from **AnhMinhTran's** [Youtube Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uUtw6Syic6A&list=LLwC_qd6q9vEqDaxU3KdSgPw&index=2&t=236s).


### üß† Algorithim Used
In general Sudoku is solved using Backtracking approach<br>

The**Greedy Best First Search approach** (An optimised version of Naive Back Tracking method) was used ie; Chooses a cell with least number of possibilities to search next.

### üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è How to Run!!
*Step-1*: Install all required libraries in `requirements.txt` or directly run `pip install -r requirements.txt`<br>
*Step-2*: Run main.py in the terminal using `python3 main.py`.<br>
*Step-3*: Nothing else, just get your Sudoku puzzle in front of your camera and solutions will be relayed over their respective positions.<br>
*Step-4*: To stop the camera, click 'Q' on keyboard.

### üìë Step By Step Explanation
|   What's happening      |   Image      |
|--------------|-------------------|
| Step-1: Reading image from real-time input or a video or an image.
|    Step-2: Convert input image to black and white. Apply threshold to remove unwanted noise. |
|    Step-3: Get boundry of largest contour ie: outline of sudoku matrix. |
|    Step-4: In each cell of sudoku matrix, detect if any number is there or not by finding contours. |
|    Step-5: Predict those detected numbers |
|    Step-6: Input the predicted numbers into  `Sudoku Solving algorithm` and get the output. |
|    Step-7: Overlay the corresponding calculated results on to live image/video.| 

### ‚úç Note
I used a trained model `digitrecognition.h5` to predict the detected digits in the image
.
